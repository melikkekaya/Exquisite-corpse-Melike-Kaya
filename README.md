"I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new empire."
The queen looked at her desk covered in bills, HR files, law requests.
Then, she grabbed a match, lit the whole thing on fire, and left the castle.
When she reached the forest, a voice called her from behind, have no fear my child, for that i am the soul of this forest and you shall be in my grace untill you leave!

However, this was a mischief. He lured the queen to his cave and try to feed her to his monster childs!!
